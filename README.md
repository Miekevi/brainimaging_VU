# Brainimaging VU

This is the repository for the brainimaging course for AI and psychology master's students at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (**P_MBRIMAG** & **P_MBRIMAG_AI**). In this 8-week course, we teach you the basics of fMRI imaging, from data acquisition and formats to analyses and inference. At the end of the course, you will be able to devise a valid fMRI experiment, and perform the basic analysis on the resulting data. That is, we will teach you everything from the basics of signal analysis, to experimental design, to statistics. The course is short, so our goal is to give you an idea of the awesome possibilities and annoying pitfalls of functional brain imaging. But most importantly, to teach you how Open Science fMRI research works, and give you a solid foundation for further learning. 

You can find the schedule for the course on [rooster.vu.nl](http://rooster.vu.nl).

Your grade will depend on an exam (60%) and a final report (40%). Note that these percentages and the course content have been upgraded to be lockdown-proof, so they will be different from the original course summary on vunet. The exam materials are the first part of the award-winning lecture series by Lunquist & Wager on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfXA4opIOVrGHncHRxI3Qa5GeCSudwmxM), as well as the literature discussed in the lectures and practicals. To practice fMRI analysis, you will work through explanatory Jupyter notebooks for the practicals during the first half of the course. During the final half of the course, you will analyze an fMRI dataset yourself and write a report on it in the Jupyter notebook format. 

## Contact & Office hours

I can be contacted through email [tknapen@gmail.com](mailto:tknapen@gmail.com), but be sure to put ***[Brain Imaging]*** in the subject line to trigger my response as soon as possible.

As I work both at the VU and [Spinoza Centre (KNAW)](http://www.spinozacentre.nl) I divide my time between the two. For you this means that I will hold office hours on ***Fridays (11:00 to 12:00)*** . These office hours will take place on Zoom: [Brain Imaging Zoom Meeting](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86981797940). The password for this meeting can be found on Canvas. 

## Lectures

How do you go about this course as a student? With a lack of direct face to face interaction due to Corona, we've Corona-proofed the course such that your learning of the basic materials is more self-paced. It's important to try to watch the YouTube modules before the Monday lectures, since our own lectures improve and extend the materials of the YouTube modules. Don't worry - if you haven't been able to do this our own lectures will be recorded so you can cross-reference these. So, you can work on these in your own time, which we hope will make your participation more corona-proof. 

The Zoom link for the lectures is the same as for the office hours: [Brain Imaging Zoom Meeting](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86981797940) The password for this meeting can be found on Canvas. Lectures will be recorded and uploaded after conversion and edits - we aim to upload on the day of the lecture.

## Practicals (& Discussions)

The class interactions on Fridays are intended to be based more on *interactive discussion* than regular sit-and-listen lectures. These discussions will be based on both *advanced topics*, and, importantly, the practical notebooks. Think of these as a question hour for both the theory and the practicals. The practicals will not be graded, but serve to give you a backbone for the things that you'll also have to do for the final project. That is, they teach you the different things that you'll need to know to be able to perform the project. 

The practicals will be given in the format of Jupyter notebooks, which you can run on [google colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/). Those of you that have already completed Neural Models will be familiar with the format. Note that you will need a Google account for accessing collaboratory notebooks. You can navigate and open the notebooks in Colab by clicking the 'open in Colab' buttons below. Make sure to copy them to your own Google Drive. If you want to know more about Colab, see the ["Welcome to Colab" Website](https://colab.research.google.com)

The first practical is not necessarily a practical, but is a Python refresher taken from the Neural Models course: 
"Practice" Python Practical [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tknapen/NMCP_AI_2020/blob/main/practicals/python_tutorial.ipynb)

The general goal of these practicals is to teach you the best & most modern open science practices, as well as show you the strength of the python-based open source ecosystem. Our goal is to show you the way forward, if you are going to use fMRI or imaging yourself in your future research career. 

## Project

To give you a taste of the practice of fMRI research, we're preparing multiple project outlines, in which you team up with 2 of your fellow students to analyse an fMRI dataset together. We hope this team-effort will provide a lockdown surrogate for actual interaction. 

The different projects each focus on a specific type of analysis and experiment, and you will be able to submit your preference for the exact project. You will jointly produce a single Jupyter notebook report, in which you write an introduction about the experiment and the dataset, perform (a set of different types of) analysis, and interpret the results. We will provide you with a couple of literature references as underlying theory, but you will have to search for your own literature to supplement the provided information. 

Grading: After the deadline, you will receive 3 project reports to grade based on a predefined rubric, which we will upload on Canvas. Of course, we will also grade the reports ourselves - using the same rubric. Please also consult this Rubric if you're wondering what is important to get right. 

## Exam

The Exam will be held in the VU standard proctored TestVision environment, proctorIO. It will consist of a mix of multiple choice and open-ended questions.
